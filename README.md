## Description
The ping_list had been developped for very simple task pingging multiple hosts.

However, after the AI era, In use of AI(Sonet3.5) made the original version much faster and very easy to work with.

The huge impact of using AI was, make the script to work parallel so instead of pinging hosts one by one, it can ping multiple hosts (Max=100) at the same time.

This was huge time saver. Original version took more time if there's more hosts.

Comparison with origianl version and AI improved version.

Original: 100hosts takes 5mins

AI improved: 100hosts takes 3secs.
